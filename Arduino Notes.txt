Arduino Nano v3
4-pin
register: data (green), clock (yellow)
ex. 7,6

Arduino Uno
3-pin (2 grounds)
Blue: data (usually pin 3)
Black x2: ground
Red: 5v

All arduinos are good for up to 300-400 LEDs
Mega is good for >600 LEDs

Arduino Nano 3.x = Arduino Nano w/ ATmega328

Teensy 3.1 (lower voltage, needs OctoWS2811 Adaptor, can power a lot of LEDs)
Beetle SKU:DFR0282 (tiny Arduino Leonardo)
Bluno Beetle SKU:DFR0339 (tiny Arduino Uno with Bluetooth)

Window: 8' 9" x 7' 10" : 293"
4 LEDs = 14.5"
1 LED = 3.625"
81 LEDs

Power consumption:
these LEDs draw no where near their spec for amps in the real world.  I had 82 62 mA LEDs run at full brightness off 3 AA alkaline for almost 5 hours.  At 62 mA, they should have been dead after 23 min.

Xmas style lights running demo reel on full brightness lasted 13+ times longer then advertised.

Red: 5V
Yellow: Ground
Green: Data
Blue: Clock

Need power connection every meter or 25 LEDs
